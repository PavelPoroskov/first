my way: ViewComponent <== ViewComponentConnected
    components/GameList -- only view component, not connected to store
    screen/GameListConnected -- connected to store, use components/GameList


index.js =use=> App.js =use=> ScreenApp =use=> components

index.js -- root App into document
App.js -- connect store
ScreenApp -- connected to store components/contatiners
components -- view components

ScreenApp use view components with react-materialize
    can change to use view components with bulma
